<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Nanobubble Generator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Gas-water Circulation Type</li><li>Pressurized Dissolution Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The nanobubble generator market primarily consists of two types: gas-water circulation and pressurized dissolution. Gas-water circulation type generators utilize a circulation process to introduce gas into the water, creating nanobubbles through agitation and turbulence. In contrast, pressurized dissolution type generators use high pressure to dissolve gas directly into water, leading to the formation of nanobubbles once the pressure is released. Both technologies enhance water treatment efficiency and improve oxygen transfer in various applications, including agriculture, aquaculture, and industrial processes.</p></p>
